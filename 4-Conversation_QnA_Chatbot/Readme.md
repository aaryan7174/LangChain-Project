An intelligent **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**-based conversational chatbot built using **LangChain**, **Groq LLM**, and **Hugging Face Embeddings**. It can **fetch live data from the web**, **store vector embeddings**, and **answer user queries contextually**, maintaining **chat history awareness** for natural, continuous dialogue.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This chatbot demonstrates how to integrate:
- **LangChain’s RAG Pipeline** (Retriever + LLM)
- **Groq LLM** (`llama3-8b-8192`)
- **Hugging Face Sentence Transformer Embeddings**
- **Chroma Vector Store**
- **Contextual Question Answering with Chat History**

The system dynamically retrieves information from an online source, splits it into chunks, stores embeddings in a vector database, and generates accurate, context-aware responses.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **LangChain** | Framework for building LLM-powered applications |
| **Groq API (LLM)** | High-performance inference for `llama3-8b-8192` |
| **Hugging Face** | Embeddings model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) |
| **Chroma DB** | Vector database for semantic search |
| **BeautifulSoup4** | Web content extraction |
| **Dotenv** | Environment variable management |
| **FastAPI / Streamlit (optional)** | For web or API deployment |

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow

The workflow below shows the full RAG pipeline for the chatbot:

1. Load environment variables from `.env`
2. Initialize **Groq LLM**
3. Load web documents using **WebBaseLoader**
4. Split documents with **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**
5. Generate embeddings using **Hugging Face Embeddings**
6. Store embeddings in **Chroma Vector DB**
7. Retrieve context using the retriever
8. Generate context-aware answers with **LLM**
9. Maintain chat history for multi-turn conversation

## 🧰 Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the folder:

git clone https://github.com/aaryan7174/LangChain-Project.git
cd LangChain-Project/4-Conversation_QnA_Chatbot


Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows


## Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🔑 Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root with the following keys:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token

---

## 🧠 Usage

Run the notebook or script:

jupyter notebook Conversation_QnA_Chatbot.ipynb


OR deploy via FastAPI/Streamlit for a web-based interface.

Example Interaction

User: What is an AI agent?
Bot: An AI agent is a system that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core controller, capable of planning, reflecting, and refining its actions to improve performance over time.

User: Tell me more about it.
Bot: It’s powered by an LLM acting as the “brain,” supported by memory and planning modules to execute complex tasks autonomously.
